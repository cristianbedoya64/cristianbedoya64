👋 Hi, I'm cristian bedoya 

🎓 Systems Engineering student (9th semester) | 💻 Junior Software Developer in progress | 🤖 AI‑powered development enthusiast

I'm a Systems Engineering student from Colombia, passionate about building functional, clean and scalable software. I focus on backend and full‑stack development, combining solid engineering fundamentals with modern tools like GitHub Copilot, cloud platforms and automation.

I believe in learning by building real projects, understanding why things work (not just how), and continuously improving through exploration and feedback.

🚀 What I do

Design and build backend APIs with real authentication and authorization

Develop CRUD systems with users, roles and business logic

Apply software engineering principles (clean code, layered architecture)

Use AI tools to accelerate development without losing understanding

Version, document and structure projects as in real industry environments

🧠 My mindset

I don't aim to know everything — I aim to learn fast and deeply

I treat projects as mini real‑world systems, not academic tasks

I use AI as a leverage tool, not a shortcut

I'm actively preparing for my first professional role as a Junior Developer
